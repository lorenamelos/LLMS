# Project: Weaving Science Fiction with LLMs üí≠

This project delves into the potential of LLMs for crafting science fiction narratives with intricate world-building, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. It employs a **multi-layered prompting approach** to achieve nuanced control over the story's atmosphere, scientific plausibility, and character agency.

## Prompt Architecture:

1. **Universe Forge:** The initial prompt establishes the core elements of the science fiction world. This could include details about advanced technology, societal structures, or the existence of alien species.

2. **Character Chronicles:** Individual prompts define each character's background, motivations, and moral compass. These prompts are interwoven within the main narrative, influencing the LLM's portrayal of their interactions and decision-making. Here, Cora, a brilliant but ostracized AI designer, takes center stage.

- **Cora's Chronicle:** Define Cora's creation process, her ethical dilemmas regarding AI rights, and her potential social anxieties within a world where AI coexists with humans.

3. **Stylistic Shaping:** Specific prompts are used throughout to steer the narrative voice towards a desired style.

- Example: "Cora frantically types lines of code, a bead of sweat trickling down her temple. The fate of countless AIs rests on her next decision." (Creates a sense of urgency and highlights Cora's determination)

4. **Scientific Scrutiny:** The prompt incorporates checkpoints where the LLM generates details related to the fictional science. These details are then compared against a pre-defined knowledge base (potentially containing scientific theories or technological concepts) to ensure a sense of grounded plausibility.

## Evaluation and Experimentation:

This would involve iteratively refining the prompts based on the generated text:

1. **Human Evaluation:** Science fiction authors and experts could assess the narrative's coherence, scientific believability, and character development.

2. **LLM Output Analysis:** Techniques like topic modeling could be used to analyze thematic consistency and how Cora's character evolves across different story branches.

## Roadblocks and Solutions:

1. **Implausible Science:** The LLM might introduce scientifically nonsensical elements despite checkpoints. This could be mitigated by incorporating reference prompts to established scientific principles or fictional technologies within the universe.

2. **Limited Character Agency:** Character prompts, particularly for Cora, might need to be more detailed. Include specific goals beyond protecting AI rights, internal conflicts arising from her ostracized status, and potential moral gray areas she might navigate.

## Benefits:

This project showcases the potential of LLMs for:

1. **Science Fiction Worldbuilding:** LLMs can help generate ideas for unique settings, societies, and technological advancements.

2. **Character Development in Sci-Fi:** By crafting detailed character prompts, LLMs can be used to explore complex characters like Cora, grappling with ethical dilemmas and societal pressures in a futuristic world.

3. **Exploration of Scientific Themes:** The project allows for experimentation with fictional science concepts, pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities to generate narratives that spark curiosity and discussion.

# Coding Details :computer:

For this project I used a model from Huggingface - gpt2, using tokenizer, generator and prompts.
